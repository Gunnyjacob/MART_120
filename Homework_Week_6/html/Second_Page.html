        <h1>Some things I like</h1>
        <p>I am a big fan of Marcus Aurelius and his story. He is known as the last great emporer of Rome.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of my favorite Marcus Aurelius Quotes</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>“Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.”</li>
            <li>“You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.”</li>
            <li>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</li>
            <li>“Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly.” </li>
        </ul>
<br />
